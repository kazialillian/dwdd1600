    <h1>Art Deco Interior Design style</h1>
    <p> Art Deco interior design emerged in the 1920s and 1930s and is known for its bold and glamorous aesthetic. It is characterized by sleek lines, geometric shapes, and luxurious materials. One of the key features of Art Deco design is the use of rich colors, such as deep blues, vibrant yellows, and shiny metallics, which create a sense of opulence and sophistication. The style also incorporates highly stylized patterns and motifs, often inspired by nature or ancient cultures. Art Deco interiors often feature statement pieces of furniture, such as streamlined sofas and chairs with plush upholstery, as well as decorative elements like mirrored surfaces, intricate lighting fixtures, and sleek geometric patterns on walls and floors. This design style exudes a sense of elegance, luxury, and modernity, making it a popular choice for both residential and commercial spaces.</p>
