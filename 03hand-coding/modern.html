    <h1>Mid-Century Modern</h1>

This design aesthetic focuses on functionality and simplicity, with an emphasis on open spaces and natural light. Mid-century modern interiors often feature furniture and decor made from natural materials such as wood, leather, and metal, adding a touch of warmth and sophistication. The color palette is typically neutral, with pops of vibrant colors used sparingly. The overall effect is a timeless and elegant look that is both comfortable and visually appealing.</p>
